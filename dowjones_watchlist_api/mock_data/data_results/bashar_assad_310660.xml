      People mentioned: Rifaat Al-Assad
      Profile:
      Rifaat Al-Assadwas ordered by a Spanish judge in Marbella, Malaga, on April 19, 2006, to report to the authorities for questioning on allegations of corruption involving the town hall. Al-Assad, who had a home in Marbella, was to answer allegations that the syndicate of luxury property owners at the nearby town of Puerto Banus, of which he was the head, received preferential treatment from the town hall. Al-Assad and three former members of the syndicate were alleged to have embezzled EUR 200,000 for the illegal construction of a private cafe in 2004. The cafe was built on common land in violation of planning laws. The complaint against Al-Assad was filed by Syrian-Argentine national and alleged arms dealer, a resident of Marbella. Al-Assad's case was part of a wider investigation into a corruption network involving local officials in the town's planning department, a number of whom faced corruption-related charges.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 08-Oct-2013
      On September 30, 2013, following the request of two non-governmental anti-corruption organisations, Paris prosecutors opened an investigation into Al-Assad's assets in France. The organisations claimed the assets might have been the result of corruption.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 29-Jun-2016
      Al-Assad was placed under formal investigation by Paris prosecutors on June 9, 2016, on charges of embezzlement of public funds, money laundering, tax fraud and undeclared work. The court also placed Al-Assad under supervision and ordered him to remain in France, with the exception of his travels to London for medical reasons. Prosecutors accused Al-Assad of embezzling public funds in order to acquire a substantial amount of real estate properties in France through Luxembourg-based companies. Customs investigators estimated the properties acquired by Al-Assad and his family to be worth around EUR 90m. Lawyers speaking on behalf of Al-Assad denied the charges and said that the origin of the property was legal and transparent and not the result of any embezzlement of Syrian public funds.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 10-Apr-2017
      In connection with the investigation by Paris prosecutors into the acquisition of several properties with embezzled funds, on September 9, 2016, police seized Al-Assad's properties, including a farm worth about EUR 7m, two mansions, and several other properties estimated at EUR 12.3m, out of concern that they could be sold.
      On April 4, 2017, in a separate Spanish investigation which stemmed from the French one, a Spanish judge charged Al-Assad with money laundering, and ordered the seizure of his and his family's properties in Spain, estimated at about EUR 691m, and ruled the freezing of more than 76 bank accounts of people allegedly connected to him. The court's ruling was the result of the French investigation, which had uncovered that part of the embezzled funds had been reportedly used by Al-Assad to buy properties in Marbella, which had been registered under several companies administrated by his relatives.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 25-Nov-2019
      The Spanish National Court ordered Al-Assad and 13 other individuals, including relatives of his, to stand trial in Spain on charges of criminal association and money laundering, as reported on November 22, 2019. Al-Assad and others were accused of laundering more than EUR 600m in Spain during the 1980s.
      According to court documents, Al-Assad left Syria in 1984 and colluded with one of his brothers, who was at the time the president of Syria, to embezzle large quantities of money from Syria's national treasury. The judge in the case said that Al-Assad was the leader of a criminal organisation whose orders were followed by his sons, daughters, wives and figureheads, among others. Al-Assad reportedly hid his stolen assets by means of a series of front companies controlled by relatives of his, and by hiring large teams of consultants for each and every phase of the money laundering process. The judge alleged that Al-Assad had at least 507 real estate properties in Spain valued at EUR 695m. The court heard that Al-Assad also had real estate properties in Gibraltar, Switzerland, Panama, Jersey, Guernsey and the United Kingdom, where he owned the largest private residence after the Buckingham Palace. Court documents state that Al-Assad also owned a vessel and a private jet, as well as armoured and high-end vehicles. 
      Furthermore, the judge alleged that Al-Assad also obtained abundant illicit proceeds by means of multiple criminal activities such as extortion, threats, kidnapping, contraband, plundering archaeological assets, seizing real estate properties and drug trafficking during the 1970s.
      Media sources reported that Al-Assad was also wanted by Swiss authorities on charges of crimes against humanity.</profile-notes>
