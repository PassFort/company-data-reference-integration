      Profile: 	
      Hugo Chavez-Cadenas, a resident of Grand Prairie, Texas, was one of 25 individuals who were indicted in January 2009 on narcotics conspiracy charges. They were accused of involvement in a conspiracy in which approximately USD 1.25m worth of methamphetamine was trafficked in the Kansas City area between 2007 and January 2009. The indictment was the culmination of a multi-agency investigation known as Operation Press One, which was led by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). In the course of the investigation agents seized around 6.5 lb of methamphetamine and at least USD 170,000 in cash.
      Each defendant was charged with conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of methamphetamine.</profile-notes>
