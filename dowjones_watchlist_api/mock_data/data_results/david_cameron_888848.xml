      Keywords: bribery
      People mentioned: Andrew Coulson, Clive Goodman
      Companies mentioned: News International, News Corp.
      Profile:
      Andrew Coulson, a former director of communications at the office of British Prime Minister David Cameron, was arrested on July 8, 2011, in connection with a police investigation into allegations of phone hacking and corruption involving the News of the World (NoW), a tabloid newspaper of which he was formerly editor.
      Coulson’s arrest came three weeks after police officers working on Operation Weeting, a probe into phone hacking by the News of the World, were alerted by News International (NI), the tabloid’s owner and UK arm of U.S.-listed media group News Corp., to allegedly illegal payments made to officers of London’s Metropolitan Police.
      Coulson was the News of the World’s editor from 2003 until 2007, when he stepped down after the paper’s former royal editor, Clive Goodman, was convicted and jailed for four months for hacking into the phone messages of aides to the royal family. Coulson said he took responsibility for the hacking but denied knowing it had been taking place.
      On the day of Coulson’s arrest, Goodman was also detained on suspicion of paying bribes to police officers in return for information. A day earlier, News Corp. had announced that it was closing down the News of the World amid allegations that the paper had illegally hacked into phone messages connected with high-profile child murders and eavesdropped on phones linked to British terrorist victims and soldiers killed in Afghanistan.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 04-Jun-2012
      Coulson was arrested on May 30, 2012, and detained on suspicion of committing perjury.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 26-Jul-2012
      Coulson was one of eight people charged in July 2012 with conspiring to hack the voice mail of over 600 celebrities, sports stars, politicians and crime victims. He faced five phone-hacking charges and conspiring to hack the voice-mail messages of Milly Dowler.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 06-Aug-2012
      Coulson was formally charged with phone hacking on August 2, 2012.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 20-Nov-2012
      On November 20, 2012, prosecutors announced that they would charge Coulson with crimes related to bribery. Coulson would be charged with "conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office," for payments to public officials in exchange for information, including a private phone directory that contained contact details for the royal family.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 06-Jun-2013
      On June 6, 2013, Coulson pleaded not guilty at London's Southwark Crown Court to one charge of conspiring with others to intercept mobile phone voicemail messages between October 2000 and August 2006. He submitted identical pleas to two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office linked to a police investigation into alleged illegal payments to public officials.
      Coulson was subsequently released on bail and his case adjourned.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 29-Oct-2013
      On October 28, 2013, Coulson arrived at court for the opening of his trial.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 24-Jun-2014
      On June 24, 2014, a jury found Coulson guilty of conspiracy to illegally intercepting phone calls and voice-mail messages while he was editor of the News of the World trial. Other charges against Coulson remained unresolved.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 25-Jun-2014
      The remaining charges against Coulson were dismissed on June 25, 2014, when the jury announced it could not reach verdicts on two charges accusing Coulson of bribing public officials in pursuit of newspaper stories.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 07-Jul-2014
      Coulson was sentenced to 18 months in prison for conspiring to hack phones during his tenure as editor-in-chief of NoW at London's Central Criminal Court, also known as the Old Bailey, on July 4, 2014. He started his jail sentence immediately after the sentencing.

      PROFILE UPDATED: 21-Nov-2014
      Coulson was released from Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk on November 21, 2014.

      CROWN PROSECUTION SERVICE NOTES: 

      Date of Press Statement: 20/11/2012

      Alison Levitt, QC, Principal Legal Advisor to the Director of Public Prosecutions, oversees CPS decision making and all potential prosecutions in relation to the ongoing phone hacking investigations and other related matters. 

      Miss Levitt said: "This statement is made in the interests of transparency and accountability to explain the decisions reached in respect of allegations arising from Operation Elveden into allegations of unlawful payment by News International staff to public officials.

      "This announcement relates to two files of evidence received from the Metropolitan Police Service. The two files were received on 30 August 2012 and are: 

      A file for charging advice involving two journalists in relation to allegations of misconduct in public office. 
      A file for charging advice involving two journalists and two public officials in relation to allegations of misconduct in public office. 
      "The first of these two files relates to:

      Clive Goodman, who was the Royal Correspondent for News of the World before 2007; and 
      Andy Coulson, who was the News of the World's Deputy Editor between 2000 and 2003 and Editor between 2003 and 2007.
      "We have concluded, following a careful review of the evidence, that Clive Goodman and Andy Coulson should be charged with two conspiracies. The allegations relate to the request and authorisation of payments to public officials in exchange for information, including a Palace phone directory known as the "Green Book" containing contact details for the Royal Family and Members of the Household.

      "The second of these two files relates to: 

      Rebekah Brooks, who was Editor of The Sun between 14 January 2003 and 1 September 2009; 
      John Kay, who was Chief Reporter at The Sun between 1990 and 2011; 
      Bettina Jordan-Barber, employed by the Ministry of Defence; and 
      one further suspect in relation to whom the investigation is still ongoing 
      "We have concluded, following a careful review of the evidence, that Bettina Jordan-Barber, John Kay and Rebekah Brooks should be charged with a conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office between 1 January 2004 and 31 January 2012. This conspiracy relates to information allegedly provided by Bettina Jordan-Barber for payment, which formed the basis of a series of news stories published by The Sun. It is alleged that approximately £100,000 was paid to Bettina Jordan-Barber between 2004 and 2011.

      "All of these matters were considered carefully in accordance with the DPP's guidelines on the public interest in cases affecting the media. This guidance asks prosecutors to consider whether the public interest served by the conduct in question outweighs the overall criminality before bringing criminal proceedings.

      "Following charge, these individuals will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on a date to be determined. 

      "May I remind all concerned that these five individuals now will be charged with criminal offences and that each has a right to a fair trial. It is very important that nothing is said, or reported, which could prejudice that trial. For these reasons it would be inappropriate for me to comment further."

      The full charges are as follows: 

      Andy Coulson and Clive Goodman:

      Charge 1

      Clive Goodman and Andrew Coulson, between 31 August 2002 and 31 January 2003, conspired together and with a person or persons unknown to commit misconduct in public office.

      Contrary to s.1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977

      Charge 2

      Clive Goodman and Andrew Coulson, between 31 January 2005 and 3 June 2005, conspired together and with a person or persons unknown to commit misconduct in public office.

      Contrary to s.1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977

      Bettina Jordan-Barber, John Kay and Rebekah Brooks:

      Charge 1

      Bettina Jordan-Barber, John Kay and Rebekah Brooks, between 1 January 2004 and 31 January 2012, conspired together, and with others, to commit misconduct in public office.

      Contrary to s.1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977

      Date of Press Statement: 24/07/2012

      Statement from Alison Levitt QC, Principal Legal Advisor to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP):

      This statement is made in the interests of transparency and accountability to explain the decisions reached in relation to Operation Weeting.

      During June and July 2012, the Crown Prosecution Service received files of evidence from the Metropolitan Police Service, relating to thirteen suspects. This has followed a period of consultation and cooperation between police and prosecutors which has taken place over many months.

      All the evidence has now carefully been considered. Applying the two-stage test in the Code for Crown Prosecutors I have concluded that in relation to eight of these thirteen suspects there is sufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction in relation to one or more offences.

      I then considered the second stage of the test, applying the DPP's interim guidelines on assessing the public interest in cases involving the media, and I have concluded that a prosecution is required in the public interest in relation to each of these eight suspects.

      The eight who will be charged are: Rebekah Brooks, Andrew Coulson, Stuart Kuttner, Glenn Mulcaire, Greg Miskiw, Ian Edmondson, Neville Thurlbeck and James Weatherup.

      They will face a total of nineteen charges in all. The full wording of all the charges will be made available, which will include the names of others whom the prosecution say are victims, but for now I shall summarise them as follows.

      All, with the exception of Glenn Mulcaire, will be charged with conspiring to intercept communications without lawful authority, from 3rd October 2000 to 9th August 2006. The communications in question are the voicemail messages of well-known people and/or those associated with them. There is a schedule containing the names of over 600 people whom the prosecution will say are the victims of this offence.

      In addition, each will face a number of further charges of conspiracy unlawfully to intercept communications, as follows:

      Rebekah Brooks will face two additional charges:

      the first relates to the voicemails of the late Milly Dowler
      the second to the voicemails of Andrew Gilchrist 
      Andrew Coulson will face four additional charges, relating to the following victims: 

      Milly Dowler
      the Rt Hon David Blunkett MP
      the Rt Hon Charles Clarke, and
      Calum Best 
      Stuart Kuttner will face two additional charges, relating to:

      Milly Dowler and
      the Rt Hon David Blunkett MP 
      Greg Miskiw will face nine further charges, relating to the following victims or groups of victims: 

      Milly Dowler
      Sven-Goran Eriksson
      Abigail Titmuss and John Leslie
      Andrew Gilchrist
      the Rt Hon David Blunkett MP
      Delia Smith
      the Rt Hon Charles Clarke
      Jude Law, Sadie Frost and Sienna Miller, and
      Wayne Rooney 
      Ian Edmondson will face a further eleven charges, relating to the following victims or groups of victims:

      the Rt Hon David Blunkett MP
      the Rt Hon Charles Clarke
      Jude Law, Sadie Frost and Sienna Miller
      Mark Oaten
      Wayne Rooney
      Calum Best
      the Rt Hon Dame Tessa Jowell MP and David Mills
      the Rt Hon Lord Prescott
      Professor John Tulloch
      Lord Frederick Windsor
      Sir Paul McCartney and Heather Mills 
      Neville Thurlbeck will face a further seven charges in relation to the following victims or groups of victims:

      Milly Dowler
      Sven-Goran Eriksson
      the Rt Hon David Blunkett MP
      the Rt Hon Charles Clarke
      Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt
      Mark Oaten
      the Rt Hon Dame Tessa Jowell MP and David Mills
      James Weatherup will face a further seven charges in relation to the following victims or groups of victims:

      the Rt Hon David Blunkett MP
      the Rt Hon Charles Clarke
      Jude Law, Sadie Frost and Sienna Miller
      Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt
      Wayne Rooney
      the Rt Hon Lord Prescott
      Sir Paul McCartney and Heather Mills 
      For legal reasons, Glenn Mulcaire does not face the first of these charges. However, he will face four charges, relating to:

      Milly Dowler
      Andrew Gilchrist
      Delia Smith, and
      the Rt Hon Charles Clarke 
      In relation to three of the remaining suspects, I have concluded that there is insufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction. It follows that no further action will be taken in relation to them. Because others are now about to be charged, it would not be appropriate for me to give reasons for these decisions at this stage. 

      There are two suspects in relation to whom the police have asked me to defer making a decision whilst further enquiries are made. For this reason I do not intend to give their names or say anything further about them at this stage. 

      The eleven suspects have this morning been informed of my decision. They are all due to answer their bail at police stations. When they do so, the eight whom I have already named will be charged. Following charge, these individuals will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on a date to be determined. 

      The police intend to contact all the victims who will then be told that their names appear on the indictment. Once all have been informed the full list of those whom the prosecution says were victims will be made available. 

      May I remind all concerned that these eight individuals now will be charged with criminal offences and that each has a right to a fair trial. It is very important that nothing is said, or reported, which could prejudice that trial. For these reasons it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.
