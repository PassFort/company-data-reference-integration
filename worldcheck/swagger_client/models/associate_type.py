    Thomson Reuters World-Check One API

    The World-Check One API enables developers to integrate the next generation of Thomson Reuters screening capabilities into existing workflows and internal systems (such as CRMs) in order to help streamline the processes for on-boarding, KYC and third party due diligence. The API provides, among other features: - The ability to screen entity names, with or without secondary fields such as date of birth for individuals. These names are called “cases” within the World-Check One system. - The ability to retrieve results of the screening process from the World-Check database - The ability to flag cases for Ongoing Screening, and retrieve the World-Check results from the Ongoing Screening process. > © 2017 Thomson Reuters.
